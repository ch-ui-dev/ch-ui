# `ch-ui`

This is the design system someone asked for. Was it you? Maybe!

- Accessible components from Radix
    - Extra primitives that should come in handy
- Internationalization from `i18-next`
- More patterns for better accessibility
- Optional Tailwind theme
    - Procedural color! (if you want)

### Why `ch-ui` instead of…?

#### `shadcn/ui`

- We started building this at least 3 months before their first commit
- This is a maintained set of components, not codegen

#### Radix Theme

- Hey, you do you, they’re doing a good job on that
- It’s probably not as extensible (read: friendly for 3p developers) as with Tailwind
