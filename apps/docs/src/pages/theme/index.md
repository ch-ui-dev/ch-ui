# `@ch-ui/theme`

The theme package renders sets of CSS custom properties a.k.a. CSS variables, that you can put upstream of a utility system like Tailwind or a web component library like `@ch-ui/elements` (or use on their own of course).

This package generates tokens using a principled approach that aims to make it easier for platform developers, app developers, and end-users alike to maintain and apply adjustments to an app’s design system tokens.

## Background

Design systems often maintain an intentionally limited set of design tokens, such as:

- specific colors arranged in “palettes”,
- font sizes arranged in a “type scale” or “font ramp”.

These *physical* tokens are the most fundamental layer, naming specific scalar (numeric) values to use. The same tokens can be redefined within conditional at-rules e.g. to support broader gamuts like `rec2020`.

The base layer of physical tokens can then be built upon with a layer of *semantic* tokens, which map physical values guarded by conditional at-rules to one coherent meaningful name, for example `--fg-description` (for “foreground color: descriptions”) can map to one physical color by default or a different one when `prefers-color-palette: dark`.

## Physical series

All design tokens ultimately resolve to physical values, which in `@ch-ui/theme` are generated by a *series* of inputs along a continuum.

`@ch-ui/theme` implements three kinds of series:

- *linear*,
- *exponential*, and
- *helical arc* for color palettes

For example, the package comes with default font sizes in an exponential series:

```ts
const defaultSizes = {
  initial: 1,
  unit: 'rem',
  base: 1.2,
  naming: {
    '2xs': -3,
    xs: -2,
    s: -1,
    base: 0,
    lg: 1,
    xl: 2,
    '2xl': 3,
    '3xl': 4,
    '4xl': 5,
  },
} satisfies ExponentialSeries;
```

This will output physical tokens in `rem` for the input values `[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` using the equation `initial * Math.pow(base, input)`.

## Layers

Rendered by:
- `renderPhysicalLayer(physicalLayer: PhysicalLayer, semanticValues?: SemanticValues)`
- `renderSemanticLayer(semanticLayer: SemanticLayer)`

Physical and semantic configurations are defined in a *layer* which lets you redefine slates of tokens based on *conditions*, which are just nested CSS statements (at-rules or selectors). Additionally, layers are where you can set a namespace.

For example, the package comes with default colors that use conditions to redefine the tokens when the browser supports broader gamuts:

```ts
export const defaultPhysicalColors = {
  conditions: {
    srgb: [':root'],
    p3: ['@media (color-gamut: p3)', ':root'],
    rec2020: ['@media (color-gamut: rec2020)', ':root'],
  },
  series: {
    neutral: {
      srgb: neutralArc,
      p3: neutralArc,
      rec2020: neutralArc,
    },
    accent: {
      srgb: accentArc,
      p3: accentArc,
      rec2020: accentArc,
    },
  },
  namespace: 'ch-',
} satisfies ColorsPhysicalLayer;
```

Note that `neutralArc` and `accentArc` are helical arc series which are repeated; the repetition is incidental, since you may want to use a different series in different conditions. How this applies to colors in particular is described in more detail in <a href="./colors" class="ch-link">`@ch-ui/colors`</a>.

## Semantic layers

Using semantic layers, you can define names which map to different physical tokens in different conditions. Where physical layers describe their values as a *series*, semantic layers describe their values as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sememe" class="ch-link">*sememes*</a> <span class="nowrap">(/ˈsɛmiːms/)</span>, which map meaningful names to a physical value for each condition in the layer.

For example, the package comes with a default semantic layer for colors to apply between light and dark modes:

```ts
export const defaultSemanticColors = {
  conditions: {
    light: [':root'],
    dark: ['@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)', ':root'],
  },
  sememes: {
    'bg-base': {
      light: ['neutral', 975],
      dark: ['neutral', 150],
    },
    'fg-base': {
      light: ['neutral', 0],
      dark: ['neutral', 900],
    },
    // etc
  },
  namespace: 'ch-',
} satisfies SemanticLayer;
```

## Facets

Rendered by `renderFacet(facet: Facet)`.

For better ergonomics, physical and semantic layers can be combined into a *facet*. When rendered together like this, `@ch-ui/theme` will automatically infer that any values mentioned in the semantic layer should be added to the inputs of the physical layer. If you will only use semantic values, this means you don’t need to define any values in the physical layer.

## Render all tokens

All tokens can be rendered using `renderTheme(themeConfig: ThemeConfig)`.

A `ThemeConfig` is just a `Record<string, Facet>` containing all the facets you’d like to render, keyed by ids you provide.
