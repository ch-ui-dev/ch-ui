# (OK) LAB curved color system tooling

This package exports functions that help generate color systems by drawing helically transformed b√©zier curves through [OK Lab color space](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/).

This package is a direct successor to [thure/cielab-curved-palette](https://github.com/thure/cielab-curved-palette/), which has substantially better documentation, so go there if you want to read how this works in greater detail, but file issues here if you have any questions or encounter issues.

This package depends only on [`colorjs.io`](https://colorjs.io/).
